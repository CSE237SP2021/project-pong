# cse237-project

John Liu, Kevin Zhang, Nick Giordano 

Our project is recreating the classic game pong in Java. 


## Structure

We divided our project up into 4 different branches: game, paddle, ball, and score. We are taking the approach of having each branch represent a feature of the game and then we are trying to implement anything relating to that feature within its branch.
