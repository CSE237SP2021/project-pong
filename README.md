# The Classic Game of Pong

John Liu, Kevin Zhang, Nick Giordano 

Our project is recreating the classic game pong in Java. We wish to create a game with a UI which will ultimately open up to a main menu of the game where you can select to play either single player versus a very awful bot or can choose to play multiplayer with a local friend. We are toying with the idea also of a settings tab where you can customize paddle color and other things.
